# Project PeaPod

## Mission

Project PeaPod is an open-source initiative focussed on developing precision agriculture technologies for distributed data collection, crop performance optimization, as well as terrestrial and space food production.

We aim to partner with academic, private, and public institutions to expand human agricultural and botanical knowledge, while making food production more accessible.

## PeaPod

PeaPod is a controlled-environment agriculture framework, designed as both an automated food production system and a distributed citizen-science research tool.

This design was submitted to Phase 1 of the NASA/CSA Deep Space Food Challenge, and was selected as one of 10 winning designs in Canada to move on to prototype a space-ready food production system for Phase 2.

## CloudPonics

CloudPonics is a dashboard for remote configuration and monitoring of PeaPod systems, with the eventual goal of integration with other controlled-environment agriculture frameworks. In the dashboard, you can view captured data (environment conditions, timelapses) as well as a live feed.

## Firebase Device Flow

[Firebase Device Flow](https://github.com/PeaPodTechnologies/FirebaseDeviceFlow) is a JavaScript package for Node.JS CLI applications that enables Firebase authentication via OAuth2 Device Flow for limited input devices. It is used by PeaPod for authentication with CloudPonics with no mouse or keyboard input.
